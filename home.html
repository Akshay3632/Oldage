                       With Remembrance Sunday around the corner, we’ve planned to mark the occasion with a Sunday lunch and an afternoon tea. There will be music, of course, and a chance for residents to join in with the singing. We’ll also continue to keep the spirits up with our regular in-house quizzes, which can get quite competitive! </span></p>

                        It’s no secret that this year has been unlike any other. We’ve worked hard to keep our residents safe and we’re grateful we’ve been able to achieve that. It’s thanks to the commitment from our staff, residents and their friends and family.

                       With Remembrance Sunday around the corner, we’ve planned to mark the occasion with a Sunday lunch and an afternoon tea. There will be music, of course, and a chance for residents to join in with the singing. We’ll also continue to keep the spirits up with our regular in-house quizzes, which can get quite competitive! </span></p>

           Over 55’s housing with Abbeyfield Basildon ensure that you can happily live your life, the way you choose, in comfort and security. Our houses are staffed from 9am-6pm and outside of those times we operate a 24hour Care Line alarm service, should immediate assistance be required.
            Delicious home cooked meals are prepared for you, three times a day and eaten sociably in the dining area with your fellow Abbeyfield companions. Meals are influenced by our residents and what they would like to eat.
            Day-to-day you may come and go as you please, free to pursue your interests and hobbies. This could be with other residents in our over 55’s housing via our planned activities and clubs, or with your own network of friends and family who are welcome to visit at any time. Our homes are situated in the heart of Basildon, near shops & cafes.

                <p>Our houses are professionally run by highly experienced managers. Housing managers are responsible for supporting resident’ independent living while ensuring that help is given where required.
                We are proud of our loyal and dedicated staff and DBS checked volunteers, several of whom have been with us for many years. This ongoing consistency means they become close friends, not just with the independent living residents, but with relatives too. At Abbeyfield, you are part of a community that cares.
                If you’d like to volunteer your time or share your skills in some way, then we’d love to hear from you. Even as little as an hour, once a month, can make a difference.
